# Project Details
This project is a web application that allows users to upload files and chat with an AI assistant that is powered by a custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) setup.

## Design Philosophy
The overall aesthetic should exude simplicity, elegance, and focus. Users should feel that they are interacting with a clear, intuitive, and purposeful interface where every visual element enhances the experience without adding friction.
- Eliminate Unnecessary Complexity: Solutions should be clear, intuitive, and easy to maintain, both in code and user interfaces.
- Minimalism: Every feature, element, or interaction should have a purpose. If it doesn't add value, itâ€™s unnecessary.
- Abstraction: Hide complex details behind simple, logical interfaces, enabling easier interaction without overwhelming the user.
- Iterative Refinement: Continuously simplify through feedback and refinement, keeping only what matters most to the user.
- Smart Defaults: Choose sensible defaults to reduce decision fatigue, while allowing flexibility for advanced customization.
